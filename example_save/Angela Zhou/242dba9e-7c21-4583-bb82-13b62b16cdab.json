Store in separate containers.\n2.  **Roast Veggies:** Chop a variety of hearty vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots). Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs (rosemary, thyme). Roast at 400Â°F (200Â°C) until tender and slightly caramelized. Store.\n3.  **Prepare Dressing/Sauce:** Make a batch of a versatile dressing like a tahini-lemon dressing, a peanut sauce, or a simple vinaigrette.\n4.  **Wash & Chop Fresh Veggies:** Wash salad greens, chop cucumbers, tomatoes, and any other raw veggies you'll use throughout the week.\n5.  **Make Overnight Oats:** Prepare 2-3 jars of overnight oats.\n\n---\n\n### **The Work Week**\n\n#### **Breakfasts (Quick & Easy)**\n\n*   **Option 1: Overnight Oats (Prep on Sunday)**\n    *   **Ingredients:** 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1 cup plant milk (soy for protein, oat for creaminess), 1 tbsp chia seeds, 1/4 cup berries (fresh or frozen), 1 tbsp nut butter or chopped nuts.\n    *   **Instructions:** Combine all ingredients in a jar or container, stir well, refrigerate overnight.

If you need more, consider spreading it into two shorter blocks (e.g., Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon).\n*   **Dedicated Space:** Try to do your research in a specific, quiet spot free of distractions.\n*   **Tools Ready:** Have all your books, papers, computer files, and charging cables ready before the block starts.\n*   **Hydrate & Snack:** Keep water nearby. A small, non-messy snack (like a handful of almonds or an apple) can help sustain concentration.\n*   **Reward Yourself:** Knowing you have a solid block of relaxation after your research can be a great motivator.\n\nThis schedule aims to maximize your productivity while still leaving room for a fulfilling and recharging weekend.

Open a plain text editor (like TextEdit on macOS).\n3.  Paste the text into the editor.\n4.  Go to `File` > `Save As...`.\n5.  Name the file something like `ProductiveWeekend.ics`.\n6.  **Crucially, change the \"File Format\" or \"Plain Text Encoding\" to \"UTF-8\" if given the option, and ensure there's no `.txt` extension added.** On Mac, sometimes you need to uncheck \"If no extension is provided, use '.txt'\".\n7.  Save the file.\n8.  **Double-click the saved `.ics` file.** Your Apple Calendar should automatically open and ask you if you want to import the events. Choose the calendar you want them added to.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Shifting Your Sleep Schedule Earlier\n\nShifting your sleep schedule is essentially about gradually resetting your body's internal clock (circadian rhythm). Consistency and patience are key.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Gradual Adjustment (The Golden Rule):**\n    *   **Action:** Don't try to shift by hours overnight. Aim for a 15-30 minute change every 2-3 days.\n    *   **Example:** If you currently go to bed at 11:30 PM and wake at 7:30 AM, try going to bed at 11:15 PM and setting your alarm for 7:15 AM for a few days. Once that feels comfortable, shift again to 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM, and so on.\n\n2.  **Anchor Your Wake-Up Time:**\n    *   **Action:** This is the most crucial part. **Decide on your target wake-up time and stick to it every single day, including weekends.**\n    *   **Why:** Waking up at the same time consistently helps to entrain your circadian rhythm. Even if you don't sleep perfectly one night, resist the urge to sleep in, as it will derail your progress.\n\n3.  **Master Your Morning Light Exposure:**\n    *   **Action:** As soon as you wake up at your new, earlier time, expose yourself to bright light.\n    *   **Why:** Light signals to your brain that it's daytime, suppressing melatonin production (the sleep hormone) and kickstarting your alertness.\n    *   **How:** Open your blinds immediately, step outside for 10-15 minutes (even if it's cloudy, natural light is best), or use a light therapy lamp (especially helpful in darker months or if you live in a place with limited natural morning light).\n\n4.  **Optimize Your Evening Darkness & Wind-Down:**\n    *   **Action:** Start dimming the lights in your home 1-2 hours before your new target bedtime. Avoid bright overhead lights.\n    *   **Action:** Minimize exposure to blue light from screens (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) in the hour or two leading up to bed. Use blue light filters on devices or wear blue-light blocking glasses.\n    *   **Action:** Establish a consistent, relaxing bedtime routine. This could include:\n        *   A warm bath or shower.\n        *   Reading a physical book (not on a backlit device).\n        *   Gentle stretching or yoga.\n        *   Listening to calming music or a podcast.\n        *   Meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n    *   **Why:** Darkness signals to your brain to produce melatonin, helping you feel sleepy. A consistent routine tells your body it's time to prepare for sleep.\n\n5.  **Mind Your Diet & Exercise Timing:**\n    *   **Action:** Avoid caffeine at least 6-8 hours before your new bedtime.\n    *   **Action:** Limit heavy meals close to bedtime (aim for at least 2-3 hours before sleep).\n    *   **Action:** While exercise is great for sleep, avoid intense workouts too close to bedtime (within 2-3 hours), as it can be stimulating. Morning or afternoon workouts are ideal.\n\n6.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Action:** Ensure your bedroom is cool (ideally 60-67Â°F or 15-19Â°C), dark (use blackout curtains if needed), and quiet (earplugs or white noise machine if necessary).\n    *   **Action:** Make sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and supportive.\n\n7.  **Be Patient & Consistent:**\n    *   **Action:** It takes time for your body to adjust. Don't get discouraged if you have a few nights where it's hard to fall asleep at the new time. Stick with it.\n    *   **Why:** Consistency is the most powerful tool for reshaping your circadian rhythm. Even small deviations can set you back.\n\n8.  **Listen to Your Body:**\n    *   **Action:** While aiming for a schedule, also pay attention to how you feel. If you're consistently exhausted, you might be shifting too quickly, or need to slightly adjust your target bedtime/wake time to ensure you're getting enough total sleep.\n\nBy systematically implementing these strategies, you should be able to gradually and comfortably shift your sleep schedule earlier, supporting both your weekend productivity and overall well-being.

The key for work week success is often **batch cooking** and **repurposing leftovers**.\n\nThis plan focuses on easy breakfasts, make-ahead lunches, and relatively quick dinners.\n\n---\n\n## Vegan Work Week Meal Plan\n\n**Core Philosophy:**\n*   **Sunday Prep is King:** Dedicate an hour or two on Sunday to cook grains, chop veggies, and potentially prep a main protein source.\n*   **Leftovers for Lunch:** Most dinners are designed to yield 2 servings, so you have lunch for the next day.\n*   **Balance:** Aim for a good mix of protein (legumes, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds), complex carbs (whole grains, sweet potatoes), healthy fats (avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil), and plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n\n---\n\n### **Sunday Prep (1-2 hours)**\n\n1.  **Cook Grains:** Cook a large batch of quinoa, brown rice, or a mix (3-4 cups dry, yields more). Store in separate containers.\n2.  **Roast Veggies:** Chop a variety of hearty vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots). Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs (rosemary, thyme). Roast at 400Â°F (200Â°C) until tender and slightly caramelized. Store.\n3.  **Prepare Dressing/Sauce:** Make a batch of a versatile dressing like a tahini-lemon dressing, a peanut sauce, or a simple vinaigrette.\n4.  **Wash & Chop Fresh Veggies:** Wash salad greens, chop cucumbers, tomatoes, and any other raw veggies you'll use throughout the week.\n5.  **Make Overnight Oats:** Prepare 2-3 jars of overnight oats.\n\n---\n\n### **The Work Week**\n\n#### **Breakfasts (Quick & Easy)**\n\n*   **Option 1: Overnight Oats (Prep on Sunday)**\n    *   **Ingredients:** 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1 cup plant milk (soy for protein, oat for creaminess), 1 tbsp chia seeds, 1/4 cup berries (fresh or frozen), 1 tbsp nut butter or chopped nuts.\n    *   **Instructions:** Combine all ingredients in a jar or container, stir well, refrigerate overnight. Grab and go!\n*   **Option 2: Smoothie**\n    *   **Ingredients:** 1 cup plant milk, 1 scoop vegan protein powder (optional), 1/2 banana (frozen is great), 1 cup mixed greens (spinach/kale â€“ you won't taste it!), 1 tbsp nut butter or seeds (flax/hemp).\n    *   **Instructions:** Blend until smooth.\n*   **Option 3: Tofu Scramble (Batch Prep or Quick)**\n    *   **Ingredients:** 1/2 block firm tofu (crumbled), 1/4 cup diced onion/pepper, sprinkle of nutritional yeast, pinch of turmeric (for color), black salt (kala namak for eggy flavor).\n    *   **Instructions:** SautÃ© veggies, add crumbled tofu and seasonings. SautÃ© until heated through. Serve with a slice of whole-wheat toast and avocado if time allows. Can be made ahead and reheated.\n\n#### **Lunches (Batch Cook & Leftovers)**\n\n*   **Goal:** Utilize Sunday prep and dinner leftovers.\n\n#### **Dinners (Relatively Quick)**\n\n---\n\n**Monday**\n\n*   **Breakfast:** Overnight Oats (from Sunday prep)\n*   **Lunch:** **Mediterranean Quinoa Salad**\n    *   **Ingredients:** Cooked quinoa (from Sunday prep), roasted veggies (from Sunday prep), chickpeas (canned, rinsed), chopped cucumber, chopped tomatoes, olives, parsley.\n    *   **Dressing:** Lemon-tahini dressing (from Sunday prep).\n    *   **Assembly:** Combine all ingredients in a container. Dressing on the side.\n*   **Dinner: Speedy Lentil & Vegetable Curry (2 servings - 1 for today, 1 for Tuesday lunch)**\n    *   **Ingredients:** 1 tbsp oil, 1 onion (diced), 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp ginger (grated), 1.5 cups red or green lentils (rinsed), 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can full-fat coconut milk, 2-3 cups mixed frozen vegetables or fresh chopped (carrots, spinach, bell peppers), 2 tbsp curry powder, salt & pepper.\n    *   **Instructions:** SautÃ© onion, garlic, ginger. Add curry powder, cook 1 min. Add lentils, tomatoes, coconut milk, 2 cups water/veg broth. Simmer 20-25 mins until lentils are tender. Stir in veggies and cook until tender. Season.

This schedule assumes you're fairly organized and focused.\n\n**Goal:** Get the bulk of your cooking and chopping done on Sunday so weekday meals are assembly-line fast.\n\n**Prep Day:** Sunday (estimated 2 - 2.5 hours active time, plus passive cooling)\n\n---\n\n### **High-Protein Vegan Meal Prep Schedule (Sunday)**\n\n**What you'll need ready:**\n*   Clean kitchen space, clear counters\n*   Cutting board, sharp knife\n*   Large pot for grains, smaller pots/pans for sauces if needed\n*   2-3 large baking sheets (parchment paper optional but recommended for easy cleanup)\n*   Mixing bowls\n*   Measuring cups/spoons\n*   Airtight food storage containers (glass preferred for reheating)\n*   Ingredient list from the meal plan ready to go!\n\n---\n\n**PHASE 1: Oven & Stove Start (Approx. 0 - 15 minutes)**\n\n*   **0-5 min: Setup & Preheat**\n    *   **Action:** Clear counters, gather ingredients for grains, tofu/tempeh, and roasted veggies. Get out baking sheets.\n    *   **Action:** **Preheat oven to 400Â°F (200Â°C)**.\n    *   **Action:** Start **pressing tofu** (wrap in paper towels, place on plate, put something heavy on top).\n*   **5-10 min: Start Grains**\n    *   **Action:** Rinse 4-5 cups dry quinoa (or brown rice).\n    *   **Action:** Place in a large pot with appropriate water ratio. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover. (Follow package directions for cook time, usually 15-20 min for quinoa, 40-45 for brown rice).\n    *   **Note:** This is mostly passive cooking time for the next 20-40 min.\n*   **10-15 min: Prep Roasted Veggies**\n    *   **Action:** Wash and chop all the hardier vegetables for roasting (broccoli florets, bell peppers, sweet potato wedges, Brussels sprouts).\n    *   **Action:** Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs in a large bowl.\n    *   **Action:** Spread on one or two baking sheets.\n\n---\n\n**PHASE 2: Active Prep (Approx. 15 - 60 minutes)**\n\n*   **15-25 min: Prep Tofu/Tempeh for Roasting**\n    *   **Action:** Unpress tofu (it's had 10 mins, which helps!). Cube it. Or unwrap tempeh and cube/crumble.\n    *   **Action:** In a large bowl, toss tofu/tempeh cubes with olive oil, soy sauce/tamari, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, paprika.\n    *   **Action:** Spread evenly on a separate baking sheet.\n*   **25-30 min: Into the Oven!**\n    *   **Action:** Place both the **roasted veggies** and **tofu/tempeh** baking sheets into the preheated oven.\n    *   **Note:** Set a timer for 15-20 minutes to check/flip. Total roast time 25-40 min depending on your oven and desired crispness.\n*   **30-45 min: Make Sauces & Dressings**\n    *   **Action:** Prepare your Tahini-Lemon-Nutritional Yeast Dressing: combine all ingredients in a blender or bowl, whisk/blend until smooth, add water to desired consistency.\n    *   **Action:** Prepare your Peanut Sauce: combine all ingredients in a blender or bowl, whisk/blend until smooth, add water to desired consistency.\n    *   **Action:** Transfer to airtight jars/containers.\n*   **45-60 min: Prep Raw Veggies & Check Oven/Grains**\n    *   **Action:** Wash and chop any raw veggies you'll use throughout the week (e.g., cucumber, tomatoes, wash salad greens). Store in separate containers.\n    *   **Action:** Check on grains â€“ if cooked, turn off heat and let them steam, then fluff.\n    *   **Action:** Check on roasted items â€“ flip tofu/tempeh and veggies. If looking done, remove from oven. If not, continue roasting.\n\n---\n\n**PHASE 3: Assembly & Cooling (Approx. 60 - 90 minutes)**\n\n*   **60-70 min: Overnight Oats & Final Roasting Check**\n    *   **Action:** Assemble your Protein-Packed Overnight Oats (3-4 jars): oats, plant milk, protein powder, chia seeds, hemp seeds, berries, nut butter. Stir well. Place in fridge.\n    *   **Action:** Remove all roasted items from the oven once cooked to your liking. Let them cool slightly on the baking sheets.\n*   **70-85 min: Portioning & Storage**\n    *   **Action:** Once grains, roasted veggies, and roasted tofu/tempeh are cool enough to handle (warm is fine, just not piping hot), begin portioning into your meal prep containers.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Create your first \"Super Protein Power Bowl\" (quinoa, roasted tofu/tempeh, roasted veggies, edamame) for Monday lunch *now*. Store remaining components (quinoa, roasted items) in larger separate containers for flexibility.\n    *   **Action:** Label containers if helpful.\n*   **85-90 min: Initial Cleanup & Wipe Down**\n    *   **Action:** Rinse bowls, put pots/pans in the sink or dishwasher. Wipe down counters. This saves a lot of time later!\n\n---\n\n**Total Active Prep Time Estimate:** 90 minutes (1.5 hours)\n**Total Elapsed Time (including passive cooking/cooling):** 2 - 2.5 hours (or slightly more if you have a small oven, do everything in batches, or are slower in the kitchen).\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Daily Assembly (Weekday Mornings/Evenings)**\n\n*   **Breakfast (5-10 minutes):**\n    *   **Overnight Oats:** Grab from fridge, stir, eat. (1 min)\n    *   **Smoothie:** Add ingredients to blender, blend, pour. (5 min)\n    *   **Tofu Scramble:** Reheat pre-made, or quick scramble (10 min).\n*   **Lunch (2-5 minutes):**\n    *   **Leftovers:** Grab pre-portioned container from fridge, microwave or reheat on stovetop. (2-5 min)\n    *   **Power Bowl Assembly:** Grab pre-cooked grains, roasted items, chopped raw veggies, dressing. Combine in a container. (5 min if not pre-made).\n*   **Dinner (15-30 minutes):**\n    *   These dinners are designed to be relatively quick, using pre-cooked grains and often just needing one main pan. (e.g., quick curries, stir-fries, building on baked potatoes).\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n*   **Listen to a Podcast/Music:** Makes the time fly!\n*   **Clean as You Go:** Rinse dishes, wipe down surfaces periodically.

Consistency and patience are key.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Gradual Adjustment (The Golden Rule):**\n    *   **Action:** Don't try to shift by hours overnight. Aim for a 15-30 minute change every 2-3 days.\n    *   **Example:** If you currently go to bed at 11:30 PM and wake at 7:30 AM, try going to bed at 11:15 PM and setting your alarm for 7:15 AM for a few days. Once that feels comfortable, shift again to 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM, and so on.\n\n2.  **Anchor Your Wake-Up Time:**\n    *   **Action:** This is the most crucial part. **Decide on your target wake-up time and stick to it every single day, including weekends.**\n    *   **Why:** Waking up at the same time consistently helps to entrain your circadian rhythm. Even if you don't sleep perfectly one night, resist the urge to sleep in, as it will derail your progress.\n\n3.  **Master Your Morning Light Exposure:**\n    *   **Action:** As soon as you wake up at your new, earlier time, expose yourself to bright light.\n    *   **Why:** Light signals to your brain that it's daytime, suppressing melatonin production (the sleep hormone) and kickstarting your alertness.\n    *   **How:** Open your blinds immediately, step outside for 10-15 minutes (even if it's cloudy, natural light is best), or use a light therapy lamp (especially helpful in darker months or if you live in a place with limited natural morning light).\n\n4.  **Optimize Your Evening Darkness & Wind-Down:**\n    *   **Action:** Start dimming the lights in your home 1-2 hours before your new target bedtime. Avoid bright overhead lights.\n    *   **Action:** Minimize exposure to blue light from screens (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) in the hour or two leading up to bed. Use blue light filters on devices or wear blue-light blocking glasses.\n    *   **Action:** Establish a consistent, relaxing bedtime routine. This could include:\n        *   A warm bath or shower.\n        *   Reading a physical book (not on a backlit device).\n        *   Gentle stretching or yoga.\n        *   Listening to calming music or a podcast.\n        *   Meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n    *   **Why:** Darkness signals to your brain to produce melatonin, helping you feel sleepy. A consistent routine tells your body it's time to prepare for sleep.\n\n5.  **Mind Your Diet & Exercise Timing:**\n    *   **Action:** Avoid caffeine at least 6-8 hours before your new bedtime.\n    *   **Action:** Limit heavy meals close to bedtime (aim for at least 2-3 hours before sleep).\n    *   **Action:** While exercise is great for sleep, avoid intense workouts too close to bedtime (within 2-3 hours), as it can be stimulating. Morning or afternoon workouts are ideal.\n\n6.  **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**\n    *   **Action:** Ensure your bedroom is cool (ideally 60-67Â°F or 15-19Â°C), dark (use blackout curtains if needed), and quiet (earplugs or white noise machine if necessary).\n    *   **Action:** Make sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and supportive.\n\n7.  **Be Patient & Consistent:**\n    *   **Action:** It takes time for your body to adjust. Don't get discouraged if you have a few nights where it's hard to fall asleep at the new time. Stick with it.\n    *   **Why:** Consistency is the most powerful tool for reshaping your circadian rhythm. Even small deviations can set you back.\n\n8.  **Listen to Your Body:**\n    *   **Action:** While aiming for a schedule, also pay attention to how you feel. If you're consistently exhausted, you might be shifting too quickly, or need to slightly adjust your target bedtime/wake time to ensure you're getting enough total sleep.\n\nBy systematically implementing these strategies, you should be able to gradually and comfortably shift your sleep schedule earlier, supporting both your weekend productivity and overall well-being.
